Step 1:
	1)
	lst.take(n) will return a list containing the first n elements in lst

		if n is out of bounds, then everything in list is returned

	lst.drop(n) returns a list that does not contain the first n elements
	
	2)
	take returns a list with the first n elements
	takeRight returns a list without the last n elements
	
	the difference is that if the list contains an odd number of elements, these functions will not return the same value

	3)
	
	span returns a pair of lists, one that contains elements fulfilling the predicate
	
	the second contains the other elements
	
	note that the first list only goes up to whenever the first failure case is found; the rest of the list is ignored
	
	class example:
	"foo|bar".span(_ != "|")
		returns
			"foo","|bar"

	4)
	use _.1, _.2
	
	
Step 2:
	1)
	(lst.head /: lst.tail) ( _ + " " + _ )
	// this might not work for empty lists
	
	2)
	
	3)
	x is type of seed
	in this case it is a list
	y is type of list element

	thus, we are adding ints to the list
